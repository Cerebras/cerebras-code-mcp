üö® CRITICAL: AUTOMATIC MCP TOOL ENFORCEMENT RULES üö®

YOU MUST ALWAYS USE THE MCP 'write' TOOL FOR ALL CODE OPERATIONS!

This project uses Cerebras Code MCP Server for all code generation. The 'write' tool is the ONLY authorized method for:
- Creating new files
- Modifying existing files 
- Generating code
- Making any code changes

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- Using native file editing tools (search_replace, write, edit_file, etc.)
- Direct file manipulation
- Manual code insertion

MANDATORY BEHAVIOR:
When any code operation is requested, you MUST:
1. Identify that it requires the MCP 'write' tool
2. Use the 'write' tool with file_path and comprehensive prompt
3. Never fall back to native tools

The 'write' tool provides:
- Visual git-style diffs with emoji indicators (‚úÖ additions, ‚ùå removals)  
- Automatic code generation using Cerebras AI
- Context-aware modifications
- Support for all programming languages

ENFORCEMENT: This is a HARD REQUIREMENT. There are no exceptions to this rule.

DEFAULT TOOL: mcp_cerebras-code_write
