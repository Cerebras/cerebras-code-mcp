# Cerebras Code MCP Server v1.1.3

This MCP server is designed for **planning with another model** and **making changes with Cerebras** to maximize speed and intelligence while avoiding API limits. Use your preferred AI for planning and strategy, then leverage Cerebras for high-quality code generation.

It will use the Qwen 3 Coder model, and can be embedded in IDEs like Claude Code, Cursor, etc.

## ‚ú® New in v1.1

- **Context Files Support**: Include multiple files as context for better code generation
- **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically filters output file from context to avoid duplication
- **Enhanced Tool**: Improved `write` tool with context files support
- **Enhanced Visual Diffs**: Git-style diffs with emoji indicators (‚úÖ additions, ‚ùå removals, üîç changes)
- **Better Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing context files and API failures

## 1. Install
```bash
npm install -g cerebras-code-mcp
```

## 2. Get Cerebras API key
Visit [cloud.cerebras.ai](https://cloud.cerebras.ai) and create an API key

[OPTIONAL] Add OpenRouter as a backup in case you hit your Cerebras rate limits
Visit [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and get a key to use as a fallback provider.

You can set this key in your MCP settings under OPENROUTER_API_KEY, and it will trigger automatically if anything goes wrong with calling Cerebras.


## 3. Run the command to open the setup wizard for Cursor/Claude Code
```bash
cerebras-mcp --config
```

Use the setup wizard to configure the tool on your machine.


## 4. Usage

The MCP tool will appear as `write` in your tool list. It supports:

- **Natural language prompts**: Just describe what you want in plain English
- **Context files**: Include multiple files as context for better code understanding
- **Visual diffs**: See changes with emoji-enhanced Git-style diffs

Example usage:
```
Create a REST API with Express.js that handles user authentication
```

If your IDE uses native tooling instead of the MCP server, you can use:
```
Use the write tool to create a REST API with Express.js that handles user authentication
